# Bio

* * *

I will be joining the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace at Tsinghua University as an Assistant Research Professor (or Assistant Researcher, 助理研究员 in Chinese) in Fall 2021. Now, I am a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science & Technology at Tsinghua University. I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science & Technology at Tsinghua University. I received my B.E. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at HIT.

My research interests include network management and measurement, and network transport optimization.
